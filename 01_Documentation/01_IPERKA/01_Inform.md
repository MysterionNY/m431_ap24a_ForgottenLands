## Collect Ideas
### Brainstorm
* Developing games in my free time
* Wanting to become a game developer in the future
* My interest & love for games helped my decision to create a game. I just thought of an 2D RPG, which includes a few features, which I would personally prefer to have in a game. Certain designs and story decisions came while doing.

### What type of Information did I need?
* Dates
    * Dates and deadlines, when I have to present and turn in the assingment.
* Deliverables
    * What do I have to deliver? Where do I have to deliver it and in what way.
    * What is wanted for the documentation and how to present it.
* Knowledge
    * I would need knowledge for designing, C# and to work my way around Unity.
* Tools
    * I had to track which tools I needed.

## Gathering Information

### Inspiration
Certain inspiration I am going to be using in my tool comes from different games. Which I will be listing down below. Certain games have functions, which I enjoy a lot, but sometimes I wish that I could combine those functions from several games into a single game, therefore I have these as inspiration:
* Metin 2 - Upgrade damage at an NPC by Webzen - published Gameforge
* Elden Ring - Dash/Roll by FromSoftware - published Namco Bandai
* World of Warcraft - Questing - developed and published by Blizzard Entertainment

### Requirements for the Product
* I had to differenciate between my requirements. I myself set me requirements for this product, but also my teacher set me requirements
* For myself I have the Functional-NonFunctional requirements
* From the teacher I've received the document, product and presentation requirements
* I used ReqView to create an overview of all the requirements

## SMART Goals
* My S.M.A.R.T goals are as followed

## Tools [issue 41]

### Unity
In Unity I will be coding the game Forgotten Lands. Its a free game engine, which can be used to develop games of any kind. It provides templates to have a starting point, but you also have the option to just use the core and do everything from scratch. With the given UI, the User gets a User Experience, which makes the work with the tool much easier. Also there is a Unity marketplace in the internet, where people can share their templates, assets & code for free or for money, which can either be used commercially or for studying purposes only.

### Visual Studio Code/2022
These tools are source code editors with certain features, which I can make use of in this project. I chose VSCode for this, because I like the way it handles the writing aspect of texts, so I dont just use this for coding, but also to document stuff. In there I will have my MarkDown files and I will be editing them that way. For the coding aspect of my game, I will be using Visual Studio 2022. With the given options in Unity and their easy to use User Experience, I can achieve clean coding in VS2022, which will then be used in my Unity project.

### Paint.net
For this project I chose to do everything from scratch and not use the Unity marketplace. Therefore I am using paint.net to create my designs. paint.net is a graphic and drawing based tool, which can be used to create graphics. For the animations I will be drawing the different frames, put them into a spreadsheet & animate them inside Unity

### Github Desktop
Github Desktop is a tool to keep track of your file changes and to publish them to your branches on Github, you can commit, push, pull and clone repositories. I used Github Desktop to track my files, my changes and upload my commits to Github. Because I was using both my laptop and my computer, I was able to work on both and constantly keep my files updated, whether I worked on a different Device.

### ShareX (Screenshot-tool)
ShareX is a tool to capture screenshots or videos without sound. By pressing CTRL + print, you can capture decide the where on the screen you want to capture your footage. You can also use the tool to draw on your created pictures. I used ShareX to capture my screenshots, which I have added into my documentation.

### ReqView
I used ReqView to create an overview of my requirements for this project. I created 6 categories to differenciate between the Requirements and created sub-categories to collect all the requirements. ReqView in general is a tool to collect information inbetween documents. You can attach multiple files, create or use templates and do full-text searches. But you also have the possibility to create individual projects with ReqView.
