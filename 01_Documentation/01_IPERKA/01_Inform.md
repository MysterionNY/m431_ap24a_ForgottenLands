# Inform
## Collect Ideas
### Brainstorm
* Developing games in my free time
* Wanting to become a game developer in the future

### How did I get the Idea
* My interest & love for games helped my decision to create a game. I just thought of an 2D RPG, which includes a few features, which I would personally prefer to have in a game. Certain designs and story decisions came while doing.

### What type of Information did I need?
* Dates
    * Dates & Deadlines, when I have to present & turn in the assingment.
* Deliverables
    * What do I have to deliver? Where do I have to deliver it and in what way.
    * What is wanted for the documentation and how to present it.
* Knowledge
    * I would need knowledge for designing, C# and to work my way around Unity.
* Tools
    * I had to track which Tools I needed.

## Gathering Information

### Inspiration
Certain inspiration I am going to be using in my tool comes from different games. Which I will be listing down below. Certain games have functions, which I enjoy a lot, but sometimes I wish that I could comebine those functions from several games into a single game, therefore I have these:
* Metin 2 - Upgrade items at an NPC
* Elden Ring - Dash/Roll
* Devil May Cry - Attacks
* World of Warcraft - Questing

### Requirements for the Product


## SMART Goals
* Get atleast 3 downloads on Github in 1 Week after release
    * Measured by checking the downloads on the Release section in Github
    * Achievable and realistic
    * Time: 1 Week after uploading a Release on Github
* Get atleast 1 person to write a feedback on Github
    * Measured by checking the Issues section on Github
    * Achievable and realistic
    * Time: 1 after the first goal was achieved

## Tools [issue 41]

### Unity
In Unity I will be coding the game Forgotten Lands. Its a free Game Engine, which can be used to develop games of any kind. It provides templates to have a starting point, but you also have the option to just use the core and do everything from Scratch. With the given UI, the User gets a User Experience, which makes the work with the tool much easier. Also there is a Unity Marketplace in the internet, where people can share their templates, assets & code for free or for money, which can either be used commercially or for studying purposes only.

### Visual Studio Code/2022
These tools are Source code editors with certain features, which I can make use of in this project. I chose VSCode for this, because I like the way it handles the writing aspect of texts, so I dont just use this for coding, but also to document stuff. In there I will have my MarkDown Files and I will be editing them that way. For the coding aspect of my game, I will be using Visual Studio 2022. With the given options in Unity and their easy to use User Experience, I can achieve clean coding in VS2022, which will then be used in my Unity project.

### Paint.net
For this project I chose to do everything from scratch and not use the Unity marketplace. Therefore I am using paint.net to create my designs. paint.net is a graphic and drawing based tool, which can be used to create graphics. Since I am going with a pixelated 2D platformer, I can use my Drawing Pad and Illustrator to draw Pixelated Assets. For the animations I will be drawing the different frames, put them into a spreadsheet & animate them inside Unity

### Github Desktop
I used Github Desktop to track my files, my changes and upload my commits to Github. Because I was using both my laptop and my computer, I was able to work on both and constantly keep my files updated, whether I worked on a different Device.

## References
No References were needed for this section, because I was already fairly familiar with all these products and information.
