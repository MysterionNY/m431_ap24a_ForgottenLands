## Map Sketch [issue 16]
* I used the good old pen & paper to create my sketch.
* I used the color blue to showcase water, green to showcase a forest and black to design the walking path
* I made a sketch for how I want to design my map layout.
* By creating a sketch, I was able to implement the features I was looking for and could create a basic understanding of my map structure.
