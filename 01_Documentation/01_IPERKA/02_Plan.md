# How I planned this assignment

## My Process
1. Brainstorm to identify my goals I want to reach in a certain timeframe & how I achieve them
2. A plan for my time management
3. My list of milestones
4. my list of tasks to achieve my final goal

## Brainstorm
* I thought of how long certain Tasks will take and what I will have to do
* I set myself a few goals and structurized my task list


## Resource plan
* I created a Resource plan to track my time
* When I can work on it, when the due dates are & dates I set myself
* I marked the days when I will work on it and for how long in green
* I marked the important dates as red


## Using GitHub as a task list
* I used Githubs internal Project function to identify my tasks and my time limit for each task.
* For my tracking I used
    * Tasks: What tasks I have
    * Time est.: my time estimate for the task/issue 
    * Actual Time: how much time it actually took

## Milestones
* With Githubs milestones, I was able to track my goals for certain dates and also my time consumption

## How I created the task list
* I identified which Major Tasks I had
* With Github Projects I could also commit my issues and track them
* For the tasks:
    * I estimated how long a task would take
    * I tracked my time how long I actually took
    * I've checked whether a Task would create a bigger Subtask or not

## Managing the task list
* I could track my tasks by putting them as ToDo, In Progress or Done
* To priorize my task list, I was able to move them around and put the most important ones at the top
* After an issue or a task was solved/finished, I checked them as Done
* When Ive noticed that a Task created a bigger Subtask, I also added that as a Task itself

## Checking my progress
