# How I planned this assignment

## My Process
1. Brainstorm to identify my goals I want to reach in a certain timeframe & how I achieve them
2. A plan for my time management
3. My list of milestones
4. my list of tasks to achieve my final goal

## Brainstorm
* I thought of how long certain Tasks will take and what I will have to do
* I set myself a few goals and structurized my task list
![Brainstorm][BS]

## Resource plan [issue 42]
* I created a Resource plan to track my time
* When I can work on it, when the due dates are & dates I set myself
* I marked the days when I will work on it and for how long in green
* I marked the important dates as red
* My available hours are 241 hours
![Resource Plan][RP]

## Using GitHub as a task list [issue 40]
* I used Githubs internal Project function to identify my tasks and my time limit for each task.
* For my tracking I used
    * Tasks: What tasks I have
    * Time est.: My time estimate for the task/issue
        * By checking my past knowledge (If I had done something similar), the size of sub-tasks the task could generate and how confident I felt. With that I calculated my estimate
    * Actual Time: How much time it actually took
    * Date begin: The date I want to start work on the task
    * Date due: The latest time that the task should be finished
  
## Milestones [issue 43]
* With Githubs milestones, I was able to track my goals for certain dates and also my time consumption
![Milestones][MS]

## How I created the task list
* I identified which Major Tasks I had
* With Github Projects I could also commit my issues and track them
* For the tasks:
    * I estimated how long a task would take
    * I tracked my time how long I actually took
    * I've checked whether a Task would create a bigger Subtask or not
* After creating the tasks and making up my estimate, I tried to not exceed my available hours from my resource plan
![Tasklist][TL]

## Managing the task list
* I could track my tasks by putting them as ToDo, In Progress or Done
* To priorize my task list, I was able to move them around and put the most important ones at the top
* After an issue or a task was solved/finished, I checked them as Done
* When Ive noticed that a Task created a bigger Subtask, I also added that as a Task itself

## Creating a Gantt chart
* I used Github's feature to create a Gantt chart with all the tasks I had included
![Gantt Chart][GC]

## Checking my progress
* I checked my tasklist what tasks I had open
* I used due dates to track whether I can still finish the task to that date or if I already finished it
* By keeping an eye on my clock how much time I had spent for a certain task, I was able to make sure whether I am in my estimated time range or not
* I compared my project with the requirements and the due date suggestions from the teacher, to know if I am doing good with my progression
