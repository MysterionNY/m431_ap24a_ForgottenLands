# Decide
## How I made decisions
* Since I was doing this project on my own, I was able to make my own decisions, but still had to decide whether I for example use a certain Program or a different one.

## Decision log
* Decision: Choose between Paint.net or Illustrator
    * Solution: I chose Paint.net because I was able to animate my stuff in Unity and Paint.net is much easier to use and free

* Decision: Choose between the Engine Unity or Unreal Engine
    * Solution: I chose Unity, because the main coding language is C# and I am fairly familiar with that language. Also Unity is more Pixel design friendly, unlike Unreal Engine

## Decision Matrix
* The biggest decision I had to make was to choose my Engine I am going to create the game in. Therefore I created a decision matrix to make the decision easier.
