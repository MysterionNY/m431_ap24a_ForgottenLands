# Decide
## How I made decisions
* Since I was doing this project on my own, I was able to make my own decisions, but still had to decide whether I for example use a certain Program or a different one.

## Decision log
* Decision: Save the game by quitting or by interacting with a bonfire
    * Reason: I chose to interact with a bonfire to save the games progress, rather than by quitting out. This adds another difficulty to the game, to prevent the game to be "too easy", therefore, to keep up with the progression of the game, the Player has to interact with a bonfire to save the game.

* Decision: Choose the amount of offered Quests
    * Reason: I chose to only do 3 Quests in total, for the time management and the resources it takes to create a Quest, I chose 3 for a clean quick play through. Though theres always the possibility to add more quests to the game.
    * Date: 08.09.2024
* Decision: Choose between Paint.net or Illustrator
    * Reason: I chose Paint.net because I was able to animate my stuff in Unity and Paint.net is much easier to use and free.
    * Date: 29.08.2024
* Decision: Choose between the Engine Unity or Unreal Engine
    * Reason: I chose Unity, because the main coding language is C# and I am fairly familiar with that language. Also Unity is more Pixel and 2D design friendly, unlike UE.

## Decision Matrix
* The biggest decision I had to make was to choose my Engine I am going to create the game in. Therefore I created a decision matrix to make the decision easier.
* My criteria were definetly full 2D support from the Engine and also the provided coding language which we code in.
