## What went well
* Task list: My task list was well structured and gave me a good overview what I had to do, when and the time consumption
* Time management: I gave myself enough time for the project and always left a good amount of room for my task estimation
* Designs: I ended up being pretty happy with the designs I had created, despite the fact I am not the best at designing
* Documentation: In my opinion, my documentation was pretty well structured and included everything important, I am happy about it

## What could be improved
* I could definitely structure my classes better, I put more functions in a single class, which I could have seperated
* Despite the fact that I had so much time, I always felt kind of pressured and didn't really plan anything for my weekends
    * In the future, when I notice I have more time left than expected, I should also enjoy some free time
* I should watch a few more videos to designing to improve that skill

## Did I reach my goals
* Feedback:
    * I checked in my google forms if I managed to receive 3 reviews
    * I achieved my goal of 3 reviews
* Downloads:
    * I checked my total downloads on this website provided by Github
    * Link: https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/MysterionNY/m431_ap24a_ForgottenLands/total?color=%23007EC6&style=for-the-badge=s
    * I achieved my goal of atleast 3 downloads

## Did my planning work
* Based off my planning, I had 241 hours available
* I estimated 240 hours to be used
* I ended up using 149 hours
* My goal was to do it in less than 200 hours
* I had a general idea on what tasks to do and a base idea for the game
* Once we received this project as a task, all the ideas came flooding into my brain


## Final Summary
* In summary I can say that I am proud of my outcome
* I set myself a goal and I achieved that
* This was my first stepping stone to a future of game developing
* For my first ever game, it reached a certain standart (An official game developer friend approved of that)
* I managed my time very well and as for now, I wouldn't change anything the way I did, with the exception of "What could be improved"
