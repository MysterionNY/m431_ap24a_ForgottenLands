1. Design testcases for specific situations
2. Create a build and test it
3. Review the code
4. Review the requirements for the Documentation
5. Let colleagues review the game
6. Final Summary

## Designing testcases
* I checked my functional requirements and identified testcases
* For each testcase I set up a possible tests, what to do and what result was expected
* I then tested each testcase 3 times before returning my final result
* Each testcase looks for functionality and if it meets the expect results
* The testcases can be found under implement testcases in: [Implementing testcases](https://github.com/MysterionNY/m431_ap24a_ForgottenLands/blob/main/01_Documentation/01_IPERKA/04c_Realize_Implement.md)

## Testing the testcases
### Testcase 1
* I tested each scenario and received these results

## Review the code
* I used my coding knowledge and checked through the code if I kept up the syntax
* By using knowledge that I was taught during my work, I checked through the semantics if they made sense
* I asked a good friend who's a full-stack developer
* He told me:
    * I should split functions into more classes, instead of keeping so many in a single class
    * I shouldn't use Scriptable Objects to create quests in future and bigger games, because they aren't such a good practice for quest systems

## Review the documentation
* I checked through my documentation requirements, which were set by Mr. Devlin
* I checked through each requirement if I finished them
![Document requirements 1][documentRQ1]
![Document requirements 2][documentRQ2]

## Colleagues review
* By using the controlled feedback forms I created in [issue 59] I received feedback
* The feedback returned successful results
* One bug was found by 2 of the 3 testers
* I received feedback for future suggestions

![Feedback 1][feedback1]
![Feedback 2][feedback2]
![Feedback 3][feedback3]

## Final Summary
* All my testcases were successful
* The test protocol can be seen below
![Testcase results][testcaseResults]


## Open bugs
* [issue 62] - Quest - Questkey can be collected before the quest was accepted
